# Version History

| Version | Changes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Version 1.3.0** | **IMPROVEMENTS**<br>* Weapon reach now includes automated talents, etc supported by the RMU system.<br>* Colours, opacity and the metres-to-feet conversion factor for grid size are all customisable in the game settings.<br>* RMU Combat Zones now starts toggled off. To see the combat zones, use the scene control on the token bar, or change it in the game settings.|
| **Version 1.2.0** | **IMPROVEMENTS**<br>* Added a minimum combat zone size of 2.5ft, so if a standard 5ft grid is used and tokens snap to grid, smaller creatures can still reach the next grid (this matched the system's approach).<br>* Implement an Imperial to Metric system using the same unit check as the RMU system ('m','m.','meter','meters','metre','metres').|
| **Version 1.1.0** | **IMPROVEMENTS**<br>* Optimised zone drawing to save CPU time.|
